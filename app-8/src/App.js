Create an app hitting an API of your choice 
(swapi.co, birdapi.com, pokeapi, smurfs, marvel api, etc). 
The API should be hit as soon as the component is finished rendering. 
The app should set value(s) on state based on results from the API and 
then show the propertie(s) on state in the DOM.
The `axios` package should be used to hit an API.
